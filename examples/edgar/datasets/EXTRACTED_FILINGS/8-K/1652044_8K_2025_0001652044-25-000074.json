(“Alphabet”), had infringed European competition laws through “self-preferencing” practices on the buy-side and the sell-side relating to its advertising technology business. The EC decision imposes a €2.95 billion fine and directs Google to cease and desist the alleged “self-preferencing” practices. Google plans to appeal the ruling. Alphabet expects that it will accrue the fine in the third quarter of 2025.",
