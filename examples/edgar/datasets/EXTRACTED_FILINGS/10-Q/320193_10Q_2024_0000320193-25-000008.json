In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nNote 2 - Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nTotal net sales include $3.7 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 28, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2024 and $3.5 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 30, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.2 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively. As of December 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 3 - Earnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nNote 4 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 7\n(1)The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n(2)As of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $126 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents are designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the 2016 European Commission (the “Commission”) decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the “State Aid Decision”), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.\n(3)As of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $3.3 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted marketable securities are designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid Decision.\nAs of December 28, 2024, 85% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 11% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of December 28, 2024, 13% of the Company’s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 10% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 28, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 8\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 33% and 38% of total trade receivables as of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43% and 24%. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.\nNote 5 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nInventories\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 9\nNote 6 - Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com.

The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following product updates:\n•MacBook Pro®\n•Mac mini®\n•iMac®\n•iPad mini®\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 12\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and iPhone.

The strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a net favorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales during the first quarter of 2025.\nGreater China\nGreater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due to lower net sales of iPhone. The strength in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable year-over-year impact on Greater China net sales during the first quarter of 2025.\nJapan\nJapan net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales were relatively flat during

first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables.\nServices\nServices net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales from advertising, the App Store® and cloud services.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 14\nGross Margin\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nProducts Gross Margin\nProducts gross margin and Products gross margin percentage were relatively flat during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix.\nServices gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to a different Services mix, partially offset by higher Services costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to

driven primarily by higher variable selling expenses and increases in headcount-related expenses.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 15\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, the impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024, and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations related to the State Aid Decision.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to the impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024 and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations related to the State Aid Decision, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper, manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable.\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured

The funds necessary to settle the remaining obligation were held in escrow as of December 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 28, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $23.3 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 16\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”) and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date, which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03.

These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nNote 2 - Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nTotal net sales include $3.7 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 28, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2024 and $3.5 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 30, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.2 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively. As of December 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 3 - Earnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nNote 4 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 7\n(1)The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n(2)As of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $126 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents are designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the 2016 European Commission (the “Commission”) decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the “State Aid Decision”), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.\n(3)As of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $3.3 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted marketable securities are designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid Decision.\nAs of December 28, 2024, 85% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 11% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 28, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 8\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 33% and 38% of total trade receivables as of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43% and 24%.

    "part_1_item_2": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following product updates:\n•MacBook Pro®\n•Mac mini®\n•iMac®\n•iPad mini®\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 12\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and iPhone.

The strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a net favorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales during the first quarter of 2025.\nGreater China\nGreater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due to lower net sales of iPhone. The strength in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable year-over-year impact on Greater China net sales during the first quarter of 2025.\nJapan\nJapan net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales were relatively flat during

first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables.\nServices\nServices net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales from advertising, the App Store® and cloud services.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 14\nGross Margin\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nProducts Gross Margin\nProducts gross margin and Products gross margin percentage were relatively flat during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix.\nServices gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to a different Services mix, partially offset by higher Services costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development expense during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 was driven primarily by higher variable selling expenses and increases in headcount-related expenses.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 15\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, the impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024, and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations related to the State Aid Decision.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to the impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024 and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations related to the State Aid Decision, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper, manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable.\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured

The funds necessary to settle the remaining obligation were held in escrow as of December 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 28, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $23.3 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 16\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”) and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date, which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03.

    "part_2": "PART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 18\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti-money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\nRisks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 19\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (“Google”) and other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, the DOJ has proposed remedies, which include changes to Google’s products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant restrictions on Google’s licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nShare repurchase activity during the three months ended December 28, 2024 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per-share amounts):\n(1)As of December 28, 2024, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $110 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 2, 2024, of which $44.2 billion had been utilized. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 20\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nInsider Trading Arrangements\nOn November 6, 2024, Luca Maestri, the Company’s former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and current Vice President, Corporate Services, entered into a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The plan provides for the sale, subject to certain price limits, of shares vesting between April 1, 2025 and October 15, 2025, pursuant to certain equity awards granted to Mr. Maestri, excluding any shares withheld by the Company to satisfy income tax withholding and remittance obligations. Mr. Maestri’s plan will expire on December 31, 2025, subject to early termination in accordance with the terms of the plan.\nOn November 25, 2024, Kate Adams, the Company’s Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, entered into a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The plan provides for the sale of shares vesting between April 1, 2025 and October 1, 2025, pursuant to certain equity awards granted to Ms. Adams, excluding any shares withheld by the Company to satisfy income tax withholding and remittance obligations. Ms. Adam’s plan will expire on November 1, 2025, subject to early termination in accordance with the terms of the plan.\nItem 6.

    "part_2_item_1": "Item 1. Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 18",
