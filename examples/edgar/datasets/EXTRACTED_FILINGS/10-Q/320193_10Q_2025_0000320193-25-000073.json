Financial Statements\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per-share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 1\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (Unaudited)\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 2\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and par value)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 3\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except per-share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 4\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (Unaudited)\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 5\nApple Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nNote 2 - Revenue\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.6 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively. As of June 28, 2025, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 23% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 3 - Earnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nNote 4 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 7\n(1)The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n(2)As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $2.6 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the 2016 European Commission (the “Commission”) decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the “State Aid Decision”), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.\n(3)As of September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $13.2 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted marketable securities were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid Decision.\nAs of June 28, 2025, 82% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 14% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of June 28, 2025, 12% of the Company’s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 11% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 28, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 17 years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 8\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, were as follows (in millions):\nAs of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company’s current and non-current term debt subject to fair value hedges was $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nAs of June 28, 2025, the Company had two customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 18% and 10%. The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 31% and 38% of total trade receivables as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 14%. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.\nNote 5 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nInventories\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 9\nNote 6 - Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had $9.9 billion and $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with commercial paper for the nine months ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nTerm Debt\nAs of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $91.8 billion and $96.7 billion, respectively (collectively the “Notes”). As of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $80.4 billion and $88.4 billion, respectively.\nNote 7 - Shareholders’ Equity\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the nine months ended June 28, 2025, the Company repurchased 312 million shares of its common stock for $69.3 billion. The Company’s share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nNote 8 - Share-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the nine months ended June 28, 2025, is as follows:\nThe total vesting-date fair value of RSUs was $7.0 billion and $16.3 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025, respectively, and was $6.4 billion and $15.0 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024, respectively.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 10\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nAs of June 28, 2025, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $23.7 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.\nNote 9 - Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nNote 10 - Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 11\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, is as follows (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 12\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions and tariffs and other measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company announced iOS 26, macOS® Tahoe 26, iPadOS® 26, watchOS® 26, visionOS® 26 and tvOS® 26.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 13\nTariffs and Other Measures\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. (“U.S. Tariffs”), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (“EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Products gross margin increased during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due primarily to favorable costs and a different mix of products, partially offset by tariffs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nProducts gross margin percentage decreased during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to tariffs and a different mix of products, partially offset by favorable costs. Products gross margin percentage decreased during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due primarily to a different mix of products and tariffs, partially offset by favorable costs.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different mix of services.\nServices gross margin percentage increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due primarily to a different mix of services, partially offset by higher costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 16\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, were as follows (dollars in millions):\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and variable selling expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to the impact from foreign currency revaluations of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was lower compared to the same period in 2024 due primarily to the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 17\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $44.1 billion, with $43.8 billion payable within 12 months.\nState Aid Decision Tax Payable\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, the Company released from escrow €14.2 billion, or $15.4 billion, to Ireland in connection with the State Aid Decision, which fully settled the obligation.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has authorized share repurchase programs. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 28, 2025, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.26 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $21.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”) and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date, which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03.

In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nNote 2 - Revenue\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.6 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively. As of June 28, 2025, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 23% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 3 - Earnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nNote 4 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 7\n(1)The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n(2)As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $2.6 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the 2016 European Commission (the “Commission”) decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the “State Aid Decision”), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.\n(3)As of September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $13.2 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted marketable securities were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid Decision.\nAs of June 28, 2025, 82% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 14% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of June 28, 2025, 12% of the Company’s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 11% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 28, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 17 years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 8\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 31% and 38% of total trade receivables as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 14%. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.\nNote 5 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nInventories\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 9\nNote 6 - Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

As of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had $9.9 billion and $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with commercial paper for the nine months ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nTerm Debt\nAs of June 28, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $91.8 billion and $96.7 billion, respectively (collectively the “Notes”).

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nNote 10 - Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 11\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, is as follows (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 12",
    "part_1_item_2": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions and tariffs and other measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company announced iOS 26, macOS® Tahoe 26, iPadOS® 26, watchOS® 26, visionOS® 26 and tvOS® 26.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 13\nTariffs and Other Measures\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. (“U.S. Tariffs”), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (“EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Products gross margin percentage decreased during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due primarily to a different mix of products and tariffs, partially offset by favorable costs.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different mix of services.\nServices gross margin percentage increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due primarily to a different mix of services, partially offset by higher costs.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 16\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, were as follows (dollars in millions):\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and variable selling expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to the impact from foreign currency revaluations of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was lower compared to the same period in 2024 due primarily to the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 17\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products.

The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 28, 2025, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.26 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $21.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-03”) and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date, which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June 28, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2025, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 19",
    "part_2": "PART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”) (the “Article 5(4) Investigation”). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (the “Article 6(4) Investigation”). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the “2021 Injunction”) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the Company’s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS® App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer’s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the Company’s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District Court’s most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit Court”). Although the Company’s request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company’s appeal on an expedited basis, with arguments scheduled for October 2025.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 20\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended December 28, 2024 (the “first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q”) and March 29, 2025 (the “second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q”), in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except for the risk factors disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of the first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q and the second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.\nItem 2.
